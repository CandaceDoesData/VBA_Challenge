# VBA_Challenge
Module 2 Challenge - VBA of Wall Street 

Per the instructions, I am adding to the README what things I had to get outside help for.

1. last row code
2. how to put a full column in Range
3. how to add up the ticker volume
4. how to calculate percent change
5. vba color index
6. max and min functions
7. looping through all worksheets

I used a number of different online websites and forums, at least three sources for every problem that I had.
I also had a tutoring session.
